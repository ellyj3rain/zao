r"""Border 2 - the version is a machine, and the machine's output is stated.

CAO's model, adopted here at [A1] (DR-009) exactly as SAO adopted it at
its DR-013; the executable shape is SAO's Border 80, carried into this
tree with its constants renamed and nothing else invented.

THE MODEL (CAO's, adopted)
--------------------------
Form `major.minor.kohai.patch-maturity`; hard caps minor 12, kohai 16,
patch 24; a tier movement resets the coordinates beneath it; a movement
at the cap rolls the tier above (twelve minors of capability ARE a
major - that is the odometer, not an honor). Maturity moves on
evidence, never on arithmetic; ZAO is pre-alpha throughout because no
batch has a play receipt.

Tiers: minor = a new player-visible simulation capability or a new
authoring/runtime contract; kohai = a coherent extension, integration,
or structural maturation of an existing capability; patch = an in-place
correction, verification closure, or repair that does not move a
capability boundary.

WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS INPUT
---------------------------------
The only input is the tier table below: one row per closed batch, with
the classification argument. Names, dates, and threads come from
BATCH_LOG.md - the index owns them, this file never respells them. The
replay derives the coordinate; --write stamps VERSION and renders
VERSION_MAP.md; the border refuses a tree whose VERSION, VERSION_MAP.md
or any mod.info disagree with the machine.

To disagree with the coordinate, disagree with a tier: edit that unit's
row, state the argument in its rationale, run --write. The map and
VERSION follow. Nothing else in the tree may state a version of its own
(Border 1 holds the doc-pack headers to VERSION).
